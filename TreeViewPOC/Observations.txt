This file gathers my thoughts and experiments outcome as the project progresses.

1) The model must implement INotifyProperty to notify the GUI if properties are directly linked. Might work if notifications (and thus properties) are managed by the ViewModel
2) In order to manage collections events, the model collections MUST be observable.
